## Feng: Classication of lung tuberculosis with DenseNet as Backbone

The file `chest-tb.ipynb` is a self-contained notebook containing all the code for the project, including the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The file was originall developed in Google Colab and trained using NVIDIA T4 run time.
